# Multilayer-Network
Python code for creating multilayer networks with examples and samples.

Summary
-------
A multilayer neural network coded without the use of ML libraries. Shows methods for implementation of feedforward and back propagation methods of updating weights. Highly adaptable for other datasets and expected outputs. Modular nature of the FFNet class shown with exampling in main().

System Requirements
-------
Python 2.7

Execution
-------
Currently, running network.py will show training and testing for:
1. xor
2. xor2 (different network architecture)
3. vh (vertical and horizontal bars on 16 pixel interface)
4. letters (identification of letters on a 16 pixel interface)
5. toBinary (uint to binary)
6. sine (sign function) 
7. cancer (dataset from UCI)
